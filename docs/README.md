## What is it?
We have been collecting color names from different sources on the web.  There are a lot of unnamed colors in the 24bit color wheel and could use your help to name them.  If you would like to be part of this contribution, please visit the official color name registry at [color-register.org](https://color-register.org/).

We ask that you try to name them based on their color, not names like `Bob's Red`.  Names like `Ricky Red` will still work as it has a understanding of the color in its name and a clean flow.

This project's color classes will be update based these updates.
